Of course this will only work if DPIScaling doesn't attempt to use something
that requires admin permissions. I suspect that it does. You can always add
permissions for ordinary users to the registry. You can monitor DPIScaling
using Process Monitor to find out what registry keys it needs write access
to.
 
A second problem is to edit DPIScaling you need to give yourself
permissions.
 
So to be allowed to edit DPIScaling.
-----------------------------------------------
Click Start - All Programs - Accessories - Right click Command Prompt and
choose Run As Administrator. Type
 
takeown /f %windir%\system32\DPIScaling.exe /a
icacls %windir%\system32\DPIScaling.exe /grant Administrators:f
 
To edit DPIScaling.exe
------------------------------
Download ResHacker from http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/
Application Manifests are a resource type of 24 (they don't get a name like
icons etc). Extract a copy of the manifest (Action menu). Edit it with
notepad and change
 
requestedExecutionLevel
 
from
 
requireAdministrator
 
to
 
asInvoker
 
Then use ResHacker to replace the manifest (Action menu).
 
To Monitor DPIScaling
------------------------------
Download Process Monitor
(http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645).
 
Start the program as an administrator (right click and choose Run As
Administrator). Set the filter to (the 4 drop down boxes along the top)
 
ImagePath Contains DPIScaling Include
 
then click Add.
then set a second filter
 
Event Class Is Registry Include
 
then click Add then Ok.
 
Run DPIScaling. Change a setting. Look for Access Denied results in the
listing of registry keys accessed.
 
Using Regedit change permissions for users to Full on those Registry keys.
