After a lot of searching I found a solution for the auto-login problem, a solution that is usable for Windows 10 Home, that has no Local Group Policy My solution also uses the well known registry setting HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\UserSwitch\Enabled, that should have the value "1". But if you change this registry setting to "1", from that moment on it is not possible anymore to run an application as administrator: normally you get a screen to enter the admin password, but when you change the registry setting you get an error about corrupted files. When that setting is reset, it works normally again.

So I had to set that setting as late as possible, just before the shutdown/reboot. The setting is auto-reset during the next boot.

For that I used the Task Schedular: I created a Task triggered by an event - Log: System; Source: User32; EvenID: 1074, Action: Start a Program. Program/script: C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe; Arguments: add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\UserSwitch /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

All other settings are not touched. Give the Task a name and save it.

To check if it worked (apart from the fact that no auto login is seen anymore) look in the Task Schedular itself: when you select Task Schedular library, you get an overview of all tasks. The last column of that overview contains the results of the last run. The date of the last run is in the previous column.
